# Install

Snowflake UI is a great UI library based on Vue.js. It provides useful components such as button, input, tabs, grid, layout, toast, and popover. It also compatible with both PC and Mobile. So let's install and start to use it! 

## NPM

```shell script
npm install snowflake-ui
```
If you built your project with Vue CLI, its default package manager is yarn, then you should install this UI with yarn to prevent any unexpected errors.

If you installed any dependency with NPM already, please use `rm -rf node_modules` and then install them again with yarn.

## YARN
```shell script
yarn add snowflake-ui
```
